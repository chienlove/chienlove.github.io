  ***Phoenix*** is a semi-untethered jailbreak tool designed for 32-bit iOS
  devices running iOS 9.3.5 or 9.3.6. Developed by Siguza and tihmstar, Phoenix
  offers users a way to unlock the full potential of their older iPhones, iPads,
  and iPods by providing access to features and customization options not
  available on stock iOS. As a semi-untethered jailbreak, Phoenix requires users
  to re-jailbreak their device after each reboot, but the process is
  straightforward, involving the simple launch of the Phoenix app on the device.


  Phoenix stands out for its ease of use and compatibility with legacy devices that have been largely forgotten by the mainstream iOS community. It opens up possibilities for installing tweaks, themes, and apps that were otherwise inaccessible, breathing new life into older hardware. The toolâ€™s reliance on known exploits makes it reliable yet safe for those looking to extend the functionality of their devices. Although iOS 9.3.5 and 9.3.6 are now considered outdated, Phoenix provides a valuable solution for users who wish to continue using their older devices with enhanced capabilities.
