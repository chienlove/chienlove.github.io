Sometimes, good changes happen for strange reasons. It sounds like we're going to see a prime example of that this fall when the [iPhone 16](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/iphone-16) arrives.

For a while now, we've heard reports that Apple is going to make a minor though welcome change to the look of its entry-level phones. Specifically, the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are tipped to switch to vertically stacked cameras, switching from the diagonally aligned lenses that have been in place since the iPhone 13's debut.

## What leaked iPhone cases tell us

Recent leaks have offered more proof that Apple's rearranging the shape of its camera lenses. Some [rumored iPhone 16 cases](https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/iphones/leaked-iphone-16-cases-show-these-pro-exclusive-features-could-be-headed-to-all-models) surfaced, and they've got a cutout on the back to house vertically arranged cameras. A [video of a reported iPhone 16 Plus case](https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/iphones/leaked-iphone-16-case-video-reveals-new-iphone-design-from-every-angle) shows off the same thing.

Those leaked cases also seem to confirm a less prominent camera array than what you'll find on the [iPhone 15](https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/apple-iphone-15), which features a relatively chunky square block that juts out from the back of the phone. Based on the cutout in those cases, the iPhone 16 array will be more oval and take up less space on the back of the phone. That should look a lot better.

Apple Vision Pro: First Impressions



Of course, Apple isn't making this move purely out of aesthetic interests. Rather, it's something the company is doing in order to have more phones capable of shooting the kind of spatial video you can enjoy on the [Apple Vision Pro](https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/smart-glasses/apple-vision-pro-review) and other headsets.
